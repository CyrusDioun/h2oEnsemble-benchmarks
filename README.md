# h2oEnsemble Benchmarks

This repository provides a framework for benchmarking the `h2oEnsemble` package.  The `h2oEnsemble` package provides an R API to train ensembles of [H2O](https://github.com/0xdata/h2o) machine learning algorithms.  You can read more about the "H2O Ensemble" project on its [GitHub page](https://github.com/0xdata/h2o/tree/master/R/ensemble). 

- An example binary classification benchmark is provided in the `twoClass/higgs` folder.
- To use the software on an Amazon EC2 cluster, follow the instructions in the `ec2/README.md` file.
